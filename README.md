# EduX-Technical-University
A common system to showcase profiles of final-year students in every degree program. The purpose of this system is that the final-year student's profile can be viewed by industry people, and if they find a student that matches their expectations, they can directly approach that student to invite them for a job interview.

The system is developed and implemented completely using AWS services and other web technologies.
